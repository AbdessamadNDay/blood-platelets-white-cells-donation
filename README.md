this the seed of a blood donation project using the MERN Stack.\
steps:\
-mimicking the "https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-blood-bank-management-system-in-php/"
project\
-adding the possibility for platelets, whites cells and plasma donation.\
-creating associated android / ios app.
-adding the possibility to operate at minimum stock to minimize the infrastructure.\
-maybe opt for transferring the project to a decentralized system.\
-after discovering that platelets and plasma are based on ABO+- same as blood donation and the already existing app: https://www.leena.ma/; which is pretty good => moving to another idea;
